##Critical Heat Flux Prediction##
This project predicts the critical heat flux (CHF) in a pool boiling system using a machine learning model. The model was trained on a dataset of experimental data from the literature.

#Goals#
The goals of this project are to:

Develop a machine learning model to predict the CHF in a pool boiling system.
Evaluate the performance of the model on a test set of experimental data.
Use the model to make predictions for new cases.
#Features
The features of this project include:

A dataset of experimental data on the CHF in a pool boiling system.
A machine learning model to predict the CHF.
A test set of experimental data to evaluate the performance of the model.
#Dependencies
The dependencies of this project include:

Python 3
NumPy
SciPy
Matplotlib
TensorFlow
How to Use
#To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Install the dependencies.
Run the Critical_Heat_Flux_Prediction_Final.ipynby file.
The Critical_Heat_Flux_Prediction_Final.ipynby file will train the model on the training set of data, evaluate the model on the test set of data, and make predictions for new cases.
